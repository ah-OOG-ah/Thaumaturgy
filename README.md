# Thaumaturgy
> Qui facit magna et inscrutabilia et mirabilia absque numero;

A mod that works wonders!

### Development
This mod uses the GTNH template, with spotless disabled (for now, anyways). In order to build it, clone the repo and run
`./gradlew build` on Linux, or `.\gradlew.bat build` on Windows. I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE - however,
any IDE with good support for Gradle builds should work.

See [the GTNH wiki](https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Development) for useful information on 7.10 development.
